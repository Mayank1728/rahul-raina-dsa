    So far we have talked about these data structures:
        1.  Arrays
        2.  Vector

    More Data Structures:
        1.  Linked List
        2.  Stack
        3.  Queue
        4.  Trees (Binary Trees and BST)
        5.  Heaps (Priority Queues)
        6.  Graphs
        7.  Hash Tables
        8.  Tries
    
    Why do we need so many different data structures?
        Every data structures has its own uniqueness, and its own unique properties.
        Depending upon the problem, we can make use of these properties to land on the perfect data structure to make our job easier.
        Based on Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Sorting, different data structures give different time complexities.
        So choose accordingly for which operation you will be doing the most.

    We will learn about each data stucture one by one and talk about their implemention and time complexities, examples etc.
