/*
    Doubly Linked List (linked list with nodes to both the next and the back element)
        IMPLEMENT THIS CODE ON YOUR OWN!

    Advantages of a Doubly Linked List:
    1.  Can traverse the list in both directions starting from any node
    2.  If you want to insert a node in the middle, then you don't need to have two pointers

    Disadvantage:
    1.  You are storing almost double.
