/*  
    "Forward lists" are more efficient than "list" in C++ STL

    Moving elements from one position to another is very efficient compared to array, vector, deque
    so whenever you want to move around things (eg. sorting) use a linked list

    the only disadvantage is that you cannot access an element directly.
