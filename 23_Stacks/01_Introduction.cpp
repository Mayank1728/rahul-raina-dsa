    What is a stack?
    Stack is a data structure that supports LIFO system (last in first out)
    
    Examples of this in real life are very common:
        1.  Books stacked on top of each other
        2.  cheese slices stacked on top of each other
    
    A stack data structure can be implemented by Arrays, Vectors, or even linked lists.
    We will be using vectors in next files.
